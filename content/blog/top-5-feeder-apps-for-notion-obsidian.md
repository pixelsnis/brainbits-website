Let's be real: Notion and Obsidian are great for *storing* things, but they're kind of terrible for *catching* things.

Opening Notion on your phone to jot down a quick thought is like getting out a filing cabinet to write a grocery list. By the time the workspace loads, the thought is gone.

If you want a Second Brain that actually works, you need "feeder apps" — lightweight tools that do one thing: get the thought out of your head and into the system without making you do homework.

Here are the 5 best tools for the job.

## 5. Otter.ai (For the Verbal Thinkers)

Sometimes your hands are busy. You're driving, walking the dog, or pacing around the kitchen. Otter is the gold standard for transcription — it handles long-form rambling far better than your phone's built-in dictation.

- **The workflow:** Record a 10-minute brainstorming session on your walk. Later, copy the clean transcript into a Notion "Brain Dump" page.
- **The vibe:** Turning your morning walk into a rough draft.

## 4. Instant Notion (The Database Shortcut)

If you're a Notion purist, this app is built to skip the workspace loading screens entirely. It's focused on one thing: getting data into your databases as fast as humanly possible.

- **The workflow:** It supports offline capture too, so if you're in a subway tunnel or a dead zone, you can still save the note. It syncs to your Notion dashboard the moment you have service again.
- **The vibe:** Notion, but without the spinning wheel of death.

## 3. Quick Capture for Obsidian

Obsidian mobile is powerful, but it's a lot to open just to jot down a book title or a stray idea. This dedicated companion app is a fast lane for entry — you don't have to load your entire vault to add a single line.

- **The workflow:** It lets you append text to existing notes (like your Daily Log) without touching the graph view. Super fast, super lightweight.
- **The vibe:** Obsidian, speed-run edition.

## 2. Drafts

![Drafts — opens to a blank page instantly, no setup required](/images/blog/top-5-feeder-apps/drafts.png)

If you're on an iPhone, Drafts is the ultimate "I need to type this *right now*" app. It opens directly to a blank page and a keyboard — no "New Note" button, no folder to pick, no settings to configure.

- **The workflow:** Use Actions to send your text to Notion or Obsidian with a single tap. Type the idea on the subway, fire it to your project folder once you're above ground.
- **The vibe:** For people who want zero buttons between them and a blank page.

## 1. Brainbits (The AI That Does the Work For You)

![Brainbits — AI-powered capture that organises your notes automatically](/images/blog/top-5-feeder-apps/brainbits.png)

Most capture apps just store text. [**Brainbits**](https://www.usebrainbits.com/) actually understands it.

It's built for the "messy" phase of thinking. You dump a thought, a voice note, a link — whatever — into a single timeline and close the app. That's it. No tagging, no filing, no homework.

- **The workflow:** This is where it beats everything else on this list. Brainbits uses AI to create **Super Pages**. If you've been dropping random thoughts about a side project all week, Brainbits automatically gathers them into one structured page for you. By the time you open Notion at your desk, the organisation is already done.
- **The vibe:** A Second Brain that cleans up after itself.
