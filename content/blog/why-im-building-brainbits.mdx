Most note-taking apps are built for power users.

Notion gives you databases, views, relations, and a learning curve that takes weeks. Obsidian gives you a graph of every thought you've ever had. They're incredible pieces of software — but they solve a problem I don't have.

My problem is simpler: I have a thought, I need to capture it in under five seconds, and I need to find it again later without remembering exactly what keyword I used.

That's it. That's Brainbits.

## The note-taking gap

There's a huge gap between "Apple Notes" and "full second brain". Most people live in that gap — they want something smarter than a plain text box, but they don't want to become a productivity system architect just to save a recipe.

Brainbits fills that gap. It auto-organizes as you type, surfaces related notes without you asking, and works completely offline so it's there when inspiration strikes on a plane.

## What comes next

This blog is where I'll share the thinking behind the product — design decisions, technical trade-offs, and the occasional honest update about what isn't working yet.
